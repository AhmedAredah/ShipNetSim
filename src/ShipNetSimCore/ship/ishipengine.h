 * @brief This file contains the declaration of the IShipEngine
 * interface, which represents a ship engine that consumes energy
 * and provides mechanical power.
 *
 * This interface defines the methods that should be implemented
 * by any class that represents a ship engine. A ship engine consumes
 * energy from an energy source and converts it into mechanical power.
 * The interface provides methods to read power efficiency and RPM
 * data from files, get the current efficiency, brake power, and RPM
 * of the engine, as well as get the previous brake power of the
 * engine.

     * 1. Low Load Power: (Eq. to L4) is located at the lower end of
     * the engine layout curve. This setting is used for operations
     * requiring minimal power, such as maneuvering in port or idling.
     * L4 helps in situations where high power is unnecessary and
     * could be inefficient or even harmful to the engine if it causes
     * it to operate below a certain threshold for effective
     * combustion.
     * 2. Economic or Cruising Power: (Eq. to L3). It corresponds to a
     * power setting where the engine operates efficiently for
     * extended periods. This power level balances fuel consumption
     * and wear, which is ideal for cruising. It is critical for
     * operational planning as it ensures economic fuel usage while
     * maintaining adequate speed and power.
     * 3. Reduced MCR: (Eq. to L2) is typically plotted slightly below
     * L1 on the engine layout curve. It represents a power level that
     * is below the maximum but is still high. It's used to provide a
     * safety margin to reduce the stress on the engine and extend its
     * life, often used during normal operations.
     * 4. Maximum Continuous Rating - MCR: (Eq. to L1) marks the
     * highest point on the engine layout curve that the engine can
     * sustain continuously without incurring damage or excessive
     * wear. This is often near the peak of the curve, representing
     * the engineâ€™s maximum power output at a given RPM.
