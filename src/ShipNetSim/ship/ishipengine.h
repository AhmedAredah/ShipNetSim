 *
 * This interface defines the methods that should be implemented
 * by any class that represents a ship engine. A ship engine consumes
 * energy from an energy source and converts it into mechanical power.
 * The interface provides methods to read power efficiency and RPM data from
 * files, get the current efficiency, brake power, and RPM of the engine,
 * as well as get the previous brake power of the engine.

     * 1. Low Load Power: (Eq. to L4) is located at the lower end of the
     * engine layout curve. This setting is used for operations requiring
     * minimal power, such as maneuvering in port or idling. L4 helps in
     * situations where high power is unnecessary and could be inefficient
     * or even harmful to the engine if it causes it to operate below a
     * certain threshold for effective combustion.
     * 2. Economic or Cruising Power: (Eq. to L3). It corresponds to a
     * power setting where the engine operates efficiently for extended
     * periods. This power level balances fuel consumption and wear, which is
     * ideal for cruising. It is critical for operational planning as
     * it ensures economic fuel usage while maintaining adequate speed and
     * power.
     * 3. Reduced MCR: (Eq. to L2) is typically plotted slightly below L1 on
     * the engine layout curve. It represents a power level that is below the
     * maximum but is still high. It's used to provide a safety margin to
     * reduce the stress on the engine and extend its life, often used during
     * normal operations.
     * 4. Maximum Continuous Rating - MCR: (Eq. to L1) marks the highest
     * point on the engine layout curve that the engine can sustain
     * continuously without incurring damage or excessive wear. This is often
     * near the peak of the curve, representing the engineâ€™s maximum power
     * output at a given RPM.
